## Background
Last year, when I decided to begin my career in programming, I took some Computer Science courses including C++ in college. I found that it is very easy to forget what I learned by the way of traditional lecturing in classroom. Under the instructions by a senior programmer, I shifted to Coursera and Udacity, and also explored some other online platforms on the market. Certainly, there are some other peers like Edx, Udemy, etc. I simply chose Coursera and Udacity as two categorial representitives here in order to figure out their pros and cons to beginners who are confused as I faced the situation.

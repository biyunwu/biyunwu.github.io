> Conclusion: The two platforms offer quite different approaches that help beginners to step into the industry. It depends on your expectation and available time to decide which approach suits you better.

## Background
Last year, when I decided to begin my career in programming, I took some Computer Science courses including C++ in college. I found that it was very easy to forget what I learned through traditional lectures in classroom. Following the advice of a programmer friend, I shifted to Coursera and Udacity, and also explored some other online platforms on the market.

Why choose Coursera and Udacity to compare with? Certainly, there are so many other MOOCs available online, such as Edx, Coursera, Udemy, Udacity, etc. Basically, they can be characterized in two types: academic and industrial. For example, most courses on Edx and Coursera are instructed by college faculties. Differently, experienced developers are more commonly to be instructors on Udemy and Udacity. Even though Microsoft began to offer coourses on Edx and theoratical computer science introduction courses are published on Udacity, the diversity trend did not change the genes on both sides. Therefore, I simply choose Coursera and Udacity as two categorial representitives here in order to compare their pros and cons for beginners who are confused as I was when facing the similar dilemma.

This comparison is based on my experience of Java programming specializions (offered by <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-programming" target="_blank">Duke</a> and <a href="https://www.coursera.org/specializations/java-object-oriented" target="_blank">UC San Diego</a>) on Coursera and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004" target="_blank">Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree</a> on Udacity.

## Similarities
Both Coursera and Udacity adopt project oriented strategy throughout their programs. A specialization or Nanodegree is usually finished in one or more concrete projects applied with those learned key points. This strategy means learners need to implement what they absorbed to build relatively sophisticated apps or websites by coding. In contrast to passively accepting knowledge by lectures, projects prompt learners to positively digest the knowledge by the rethinking process of coding. Furthermore, those finished projects can be really helpful which prove coding experience while job hunting.

## Differences

### Academic Coursera
Courses on Coursera are somehow academic. No matter which intro-programming course you take, you are probably going to follow this routine:
[1]Primitive type, variable, condition operator, loop;
[2]Fuction, object, class, array, list;
[3]Instance, instance constructor & variable;
[5]Inherentance, polymorphism;
[6]Sorting algrithms, Big-O notation, linked list
......

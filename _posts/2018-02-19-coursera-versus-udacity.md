> Conclusion: The two platforms offer quite different approaches that help beginners to step into the industry. It depends on your expectation and time span to decide which approach suits you better.

## Background
Last year, when I decided to begin my career in programming, I took some Computer Science courses including C++ in college. I found that it was very easy to forget what I learned through traditional lectures in classroom. Following the advice of a programmer friend, I shifted to Coursera and Udacity, and also explored some other online platforms on the market. Certainly, there are some other peers like Edx, Udemy, etc. I simply choose Coursera and Udacity as two categorial representitives here in order to compare their pros and cons for beginners who are confused as I was when facing the similar dilemma.
